 * 19950223 AL:  fixed wrong magic numbers
 *               ["version 1.1"]
 *               ---------------
 * 19950313 AL:  CRC code from PNG spec; compiles on memory-impaired PCs now;
 *               check for IHDR/IEND chunks
 *               ["version 1.2"]
 *               ---------------
 * 19950325 GRP: rewrote magic-number-checking and moved it to PNG_check_magic()
 *               ["version 1.3"]
 *               ---------------
 * 19950327 AL:  fixed CRC code for 64-bit; -t switch; unsigned char vs. char
 *               pointer changes
 *               ["version 1.4"]
 *               ---------------

 *               ["version 1.5"]
 *               ---------------
 * 19950601 GRR: reformatted; print tEXt and zTXt keywords; added usage
 * 19950601 GRR: released version 1.6, a.k.a. pngcheck-grr1.c
 *               --------------------------------------------
 * 19950607 GRR: print image info (IHDR) and tIME; enable EMX wildcards
 * 19950615 GRR: released version 1.61, a.k.a. pngcheck-grr2.c
 *               ---------------------------------------------
 * 19950731 AL:  check for control chars; check for MacBinary header; new
 *               force option

 *               --------------------
 * 19950827 AL:  merged Greg's 1.61 changes: print IHDR and tIME contents,
 *               call emx wildcard function
 * 19950827 AL:  released version 1.8
 *               --------------------
 * 19950904 GRR: added brackets on keyword error messages to distinguish from

 * 19951121 AED: re-ordered internal chunk checking in pngcheck().
 *               Now decodes most of the known chunk types to check for invalid
 *               contents (except IDAT and zTXt).  Information is printed
 *               about the contents of known chunks, and unknown chunks have
 *               their chunk name flags decoded.  Also checks chunk ordering.
 * 19951121 AED: released version 1.9
 *               --------------------

 *               I currently don't remember) (complained about missing palette
 *               in greyscale images, missing breaks in case statement); avoid
 *               reference to undefined array entry with out of range ityp
 * 19960521 AL:  released version 1.95
 *               ---------------------

 * 19961231 JB:  add decoding of the zlib header from the first IDAT chunk (16-
 *               bit header code in first two bytes, see print_zlibheader).
 * 19970102 GRR: more sensible zlib-header output (version "1.97grr"); nuked
 *               some tabs; fixed blank lines between files in verbose output
 * 19970106 AED: initialize the command-line flags; add macros to ensure the
 *               error level doesn't go down; return error level to calling
 *               program; consolidate PNG magic on one place; add "-" as input
 *               file for stdin; check for valid tEXt/zTXt keywords per PNG
 *               Spec 1.0; slight modification to output of tEXt/zTXt keywords/
 *               contents; change 'extract' to output only valid chunks (unless
