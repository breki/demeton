## Thu 5.9.
- Finished implementing `Srtm.createSrtmTileFromStream`.
- Fixed the initialization of cells in `HeightsArray` so it is done only once.
- Inlined some of the methods to improve performance, but it's still way too slow.
- Renamed `HeightArray` to `HeightsArray`.
- Started implementing reading of a whole HGT file.
- Implemented `Srtm.tileCellMinCoords` function.

## Wed 4.9.
- Introduced SrtmLongitude and SrtmLatitude types.

## Tue 3.9.
- Implemented readSrtmHeightsFromStream function.

## Mon 02.09.
- Introduced GlobalCellCoords which helped me root out the bug with HeightsArray merging.

## Sun 01.09.
- the constructor of the HeightArray now accepts a function for initializing
- made some changes in how the HeightArray is structured
- renamed DemData to HeightArray

## Sun 18.08.
