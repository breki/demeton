- the whole thing is just too damn slow, how do we speed it up?
    - inline certain functions
    - optimize `minSumOfAbsoluteValueSelector`

    - sum of absolute differences should be returned by filter method so we don't need to go through the list again

- implement converter of HGT files into PNG
    - also implement decoder back and write property tests

- implement PNG writing
    - add support for RGBA

- hillshading algorithm
    - takes the `HeightsArray` and executes the Igor's shading algorithm
