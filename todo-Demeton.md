- implement PNG writing
    - reading should implement some kind of routing for chunks
    - property test for IDAT chunks
        - also make sure the decompressed array has a modulo of 0
    - document `Demeton.Png` and `Demeton.PngFilters` modules
    - property test that generates a PNG from a data array and then decodes it back
    - prepare a test case for generating the simplest PNG
    - first grayscale (and with transparency, if possible)

- hillshading algorithm
    - takes the `HeightsArray` and executes the Igor's shading algorithm
    - produces what?
        - let's implement our own image type, for now
    - how to render it to a PNG?
